## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of
the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS
files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
Udacity Classroom.

## ES6

I used several ES6 methods and also Javascript and browser functions which are
only available in the latest modern browsers, e.g. `IntersectionObserver`.
Though those are working with the latest browsers except IE 11, IE 10 and Opera
mini/mobile.

Most of the changes have happened in the `js/app.js` file and some changes for
styling in `styles.css`

## Styles
Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience. One notable thing is the hover animation on the active navigation header.

## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
